# Code Check Complexity - VS Code Extension

## Concept

Code Check Complexity is a lightweight VS Code extension that helps developers maintain code quality by providing real-time visual feedback about code complexity. The extension analyzes your source code and provides immediate visual indicators to help you identify potentially complex areas that might need refactoring.

## How It Works

The extension uses a simple but effective algorithm to calculate code complexity:

1. Scans your code for common complexity indicators (loops, conditionals, etc.)
2. Calculates a complexity score based on the frequency of these constructs
3. Classifies the code into three levels (Low, Medium, High)
4. Provides visual feedback through multiple channels

## Features

### Core Functionality

- **Automatic Analysis**: Runs on file open, save, and editor switch
- **Multi-language Support**: Works with most programming languages (JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, C#, etc.)
- **Non-intrusive**: Provides feedback without disrupting your workflow

### Visual Indicators

| Indicator | Location | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Status Bar | Status Bar | Shows current file's complexity percentage |
| File Badge | File Explorer | Color-coded badge (L/M/H) next to each file |
| Tooltip | Hover Effects | Detailed tooltips on all indicators |

### Complexity Classification

| Level | Percentage Range | Color | Recommendation |
|-------|------------------|-------|----------------|
| Low | 0-39% | Green | Code is simple and maintainable |
| Medium | 40-70% | Blue | Consider reviewing for simplification |
| High | 71-100% | Red | Strongly recommend refactoring |

## Installation

1. Open VS Code's Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X` or `Cmd+Shift+X` on Mac)
2. Search for "Code Check Complexity"
3. Click Install
4. Reload VS Code if prompted

## Usage

The extension works automatically out of the box. For manual control:

### Basic Commands

1. Open Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac)
2. Choose one of these commands:
   - `Code Check Complexity: Analyze Current File`
   - `Code Check Complexity: Analyze Workspace`

### Keyboard Shortcuts

Add these to your `keybindings.json` for quick access:
```json
{
  "key": "ctrl+alt+c",
  "command": "codeCheckComplexity.analyze"
}

## Configuration

Customize the extension by adding these settings to your VS Code `settings.json`:

```json
{
  // Complexity calculation settings
  "codeCheckComplexity.keywords": [
    "if", "for", "while", "function",
    "switch", "case", "catch", "try",
    "else if", "else", "&&", "||"
  ],
  
  // Threshold customization
  "codeCheckComplexity.lowThreshold": 40,
  "codeCheckComplexity.mediumThreshold": 70,
  
  // Display preferences
  "codeCheckComplexity.showStatusBar": true,
  "codeCheckComplexity.showFileDecorations": true
}```


## Technical Details

### Calculation Method

```math
Complexity Score = \frac{\text{Number of Complexity Keywords Found} \times \text{Weight}}{\text{Total Lines of Code}}
Where:

Default weight per keyword: 10

Maximum score capped at 100%
```

## Performance Considerations

- ‚ö° **Efficient analysis**: Runs in the background with minimal performance impact
- üìÑ **Targeted scanning**: Only analyzes active documents
- üóÑÔ∏è **Smart caching**: Caches results for better performance
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Debounced processing**: Avoids unnecessary repeated analysis

## Note: This extension provides heuristic-based complexity analysis. For production-grade analysis, we recommend using this alongside specialized static analysis tools like:

SonarQube

CodeClimate
```
ESLint (for JavaScript/TypeScript)
```
